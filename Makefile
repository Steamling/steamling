# steamling: Arch-ARM dual-session distro for Qualcomm handhelds (DEVICE=<soc> picks the SoC family)
# See "Building" in CONTRIBUTING.md for the build quick start.
#
# Most targets build an aarch64 Linux image and must run on a Linux host as root
# (chroot/mount). Override config in config/steamling.conf or via the environment.

image: ## Everything from host check to flashable SD image, skipping what is current (as yourself; sudo once). SSH=1: SSH on. Same as ./build.sh
	@$(SCRIPTS)/build-all.sh

rootfs: ## make image without the SD image: stops at the finished rootfs in build/rootfs
	@$(SCRIPTS)/build-all.sh --no-sd-image

update: ## Only the kernel and the packages that changed, for updating a handheld over the network (docs/updating.md). Same as ./build.sh --update
	@$(SCRIPTS)/build-all.sh --update

status: ## Where the running (or last) make image is, and its time left
	@$(SCRIPTS)/build-status.sh

watch: ## make status, redrawn every 2 s until the build ends (Ctrl-C stops watching, not the build)
	@$(SCRIPTS)/build-status.sh --watch

host-setup: ## Install this host's build tools and give qemu's binfmt the C flag (Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch; uses sudo)
	@$(SCRIPTS)/host-setup.sh

sync: ## Fetch ROCKNIX reference material into vendor/ from the pinned commit (STEAMLING_SYNC_SCOPE=all also moves kernel/)
	@$(SCRIPTS)/sync.sh

bootstrap: ## Download + verify + extract the ALARM base rootfs (root, Linux)
	@$(SCRIPTS)/bootstrap.sh

build: ## Image build: bootstrap -> packages -> assemble; needs 'make kernel' first (root, Linux); STEAMLING_EMULATION=1 bakes in the emulation layer
	@$(SCRIPTS)/build-image.sh

kernel: ## Build only the in-project kernel (linux-steamling-<soc>); does nothing if its inputs are unchanged
	@$(SCRIPTS)/build-kernel.sh

packages: ## Build local steamling-* packages -> build/localrepo/{<soc>,shared} (root); skips up-to-date ones. PKG="a b" forces a subset
	@$(SCRIPTS)/build-packages.sh $(PKG)

seed: ## Fill build/localrepo from the published repo, so 'make build' compiles only what differs (root)
	@$(SCRIPTS)/seed-localrepo.sh

pending: ## List the packages 'make build' would compile (missing or stale in build/localrepo)
	@$(SCRIPTS)/pending.sh

sd-image: ## Build a flashable SD boot-test image (needs build + kernel) (root, Linux)
	@$(SCRIPTS)/build-sd-image.sh

snapshot: ## Freeze the ALARM base a fresh build used -> [pocknix-base] on R2 + lockfile + pins (user, no sudo)
	@$(SCRIPTS)/snapshot-base.sh

base-diff: ## Vet a snapshot dry run: watchlist moves + open upstream issues, fresh upstream bumps (auto after a dry run)
	@$(SCRIPTS)/base-diff.sh

extend-base: ## Host extra ALARM packages in the LIVE base without a re-cut (PKG="samba ..."; deps must already be in it; user, no sudo)
	@$(SCRIPTS)/extend-base.sh $(PKG)

stage: ## Mirror the LIVE repo into build/stage + swap in PKG="a b" (publish source; user, no sudo). DROP="x" removes a live package
	@STEAMLING_STAGE_DROP="$(DROP)" $(SCRIPTS)/stage-repo.sh $(PKG)

stage-check: ## Re-run the consistency gate on the staged repo (runs automatically at the end of 'make stage')
	@$(SCRIPTS)/stage-check.sh

publish: ## Sign + publish the staged repo (run 'make stage' first; user, no sudo)
	@$(SCRIPTS)/publish-repo.sh $(PUBLISH_ARGS)

stage-shared: ## Stage the SoC-neutral [steamling-shared] repo (PKG="a b" [DROP="x"]; once, not per SoC)
	@STEAMLING_REPO_SCOPE=shared STEAMLING_STAGE_DROP="$(DROP)" $(SCRIPTS)/stage-repo.sh $(PKG)

stage-check-shared: ## Re-run the consistency gate on the staged [steamling-shared] repo
	@STEAMLING_REPO_SCOPE=shared $(SCRIPTS)/stage-check.sh

publish-shared: ## Sign + publish the staged [steamling-shared] repo (run 'make stage-shared' first)
	@STEAMLING_REPO_SCOPE=shared $(SCRIPTS)/publish-repo.sh $(PUBLISH_ARGS)

publish-image: ## Compress + checksum + upload the SD image for download
	@$(SCRIPTS)/publish-image.sh

install: ## Point at the on-device internal installer (steamling-install-internal); nothing runs on the host
	@$(SCRIPTS)/install.sh

check: ## Preflight: validate harness + any built artifacts
	@$(SCRIPTS)/check.sh

mirrors: ## Clone or update the upstream reference mirrors in build/mirrors (config/mirrors.list; Windows: scripts/mirrors.ps1)
	@$(SCRIPTS)/mirrors.sh

du: ## Show build/ disk usage breakdown (find the space hogs)
